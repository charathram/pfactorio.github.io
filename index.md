##What is PFactor?##
PFactor.io is a free website that focuses on both, Electronics and Aviation. Our aim is to provide you with interesting tutorials, articles, and resources that deal with these topics.

##Why Electronics and Aviation?##
The creators of PFactor have interests in both these fields. The name of the site represents a concept that occurs, both in electrical engineering, and in aviation.

In electrical engineering, the PFactor (or power factor) is the ratio of true power to AC power. In aviation, the PFactor is one of the causes of the left-turning tendencies of propeller-driven airplanes.
