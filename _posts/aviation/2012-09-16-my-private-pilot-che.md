As I mentioned earlier, I passed my Private Pilot checkride this week. I’m
really happy that the training that I started, with some trepidation, about
a year ago finally resulted in my getting a Private Pilot’s License (PPL).

While I was preparing for the checkride, I kept searching on the web for any
information about the checkride, and I found very little. So, this is my
attempt at trying to add to the rather small body of knowledge that exists
on the Internet about the Private Pilot checkride.

This is the first of a three-part series about my checkride. The
other two parts will be posted shortly.

## What is a “Checkride”?

A “checkride” is just what it says :) OK. That didn’t help much did it?
Alright here goes my definition of the term checkride.

<dl>

<dt>**Checkride**</dt>

<dd>A practical test, administered by an FAA-Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), consisting of an oral test and a flight test, which is used to certify a candidate for a pilot’s license.</dd>

With the definition out of the way, I’m going to talk a little more about
the checkride itself. In subsequent posts, I will blog more about the
preparation itself.

## The Morning of the Checkride

As I mentioned above, the checkride typically consists of an oral portion
and a flight portion. My checkride had been scheduled for Tuesday, September
11, 2012 at 8:30AM in my flight school, [DuBois Aviation](http://www.duboisaviation.com/ "DuBois Aviation").

I had called the DPE the previous day and he asked me to plan a
cross-country flight to Henderson Executive Airport (KHND) just south of
Las Vegas. I also took the opportunity to ask him how much he
weighed and if he would be bringing any baggage with him so that I
could get a head start on the weight and balance calculations.

On Monday night, I finished up my flight plan and the weight and
balance calculations for the flight. I tried to get enough sleep,
but all I could muster was about 3 hours (woefully inadequate for
the long day that was to come).

I woke up at 5:00AM, as I had planned, showered and at 6:00AM called
Flight Service (1–800-WX-BRIEF) for the weather briefing. I
remembered to write down the information they gave me to the best of
my ability, knowing fully well that the briefer was going to talk
really fast and that I would have to supplement the weather briefing
with data from [DUAT](http://www.duat.com/ "DUAT").

The weather briefing made me fairly confident that I could fly this
route if I had to. VFR weather throughout the Southern California
and Southern Nevada regions. Some thunderstorm activity to the east
of KHND, no convective SIGMETs that were to be in effect. The only
TFRs were a fire fighting TFR over the San Gabriel mountains and a
TFR for September 12 over Las Vegas for President Obama’s visit.

I wrote this all down and then transcribed this information, along
with the data from [DUAT](http://www.duat.com/ "DUAT") into a weather briefing form that my
CFI had given me.

That completed the entire flight planning section of my pre-work.

I left home at 7:15AM to ensure I gave myself enough time to reach
[DuBois Aviation](http://www.duboisaviation.com/ "DuBois Aviation") and settle down for the oral exam. With
some traffic, I reached DuBois at 8:00AM - in good time for the DPE
to show up.

So, that’s it for this part. I will shortly post more about the oral
exam as well as the actual flight portion.
